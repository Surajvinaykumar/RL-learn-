# About me
This summer, I’ve decided to dive into Reinforcement Learning. I'm a project-driven learner — I grasp concepts best by building and experimenting rather than just reading books. So, I’ll be starting with a simple problem and documenting everything along the way: the key observations, the underlying math, and a breakdown of what’s actually happening in the code. As I progress and grow more confident, I’ll move on to tackle more complex problems and environments.

### TrainingRL.py
In the TrainingRL.py, i have tried to solve the CartPole problem, where the agent must balance a pole on the cart by moving it left or right, and the feedback (reward) of +1 will be given everytime the agent balances the pole
